    - What advantage(s) did your non-VPN solution have?


3. Explain the Solution Requirements

    - Would a VPN meet the access control requirements you had for Project 1?
    - How would a VPN protect the network just as well, or better, than your current solution?

    - Under what circumstances is a VPN a good solution?

    - When, if ever, is a VPN "overkill"?

**Question 3: Containers**

When is it appropriate to use containers in cloud deployments, and what are the security benefits of doing so?

1. Restate the Problem

2. Provide a Concrete Example Scenario

    - In Project 1, when did you use containers?
    - What did you use containers for?

3. Explain the Solution Requirements

    - Why was this an appropriate use for containers?
    - What security benefits did you expect from using containers?


4. Explain the Solution Details

    - In Project 1, how did you configure VMs to be able to run containers?
    - How did you select and install the correct container?
    - How did you verify that it was running correctly?

5. Identify Advantages/Disadvantages of the Solution

    - How would you have achieved the same thing without containers?
    - What are the advantages to doing it without containers?
    - What are the disadvantages?


**Question 4: Cloud Infrastructure as Code**

What are the security benefits of defining cloud infrastructure as code?


1. Restate the Problem

2. Provide a Concrete Example Scenario

    - In Project 1, when did you use infrastructure as code (IaC)?
    - What tool did you use?
    - What did you use it to do?


3. Explain the Solution Requirements

    - Were there any alternatives to IaC?
    - What benefits does IaC have over alternative approaches?


4. Explain the Solution Details

    - In Project 1, which specific configurations did your IaC set up?
    - How did you run and test these configurations?


5. Identify Advantages/Disadvantages of the Solution

    - Are there any disadvantages to using IaC over the "traditional" approach?


#### Domain: Logging and Monitoring

**Question 1: Setting Alerts in a New Monitoring System**

How do you determine which alerts to set in a new monitoring system?

Note: In Project 1, you did not set up any alerts. However, you still have enough experience to answer this question.


1. Restate the Problem

2. Provide a Concrete Example Scenario

    - Describe the network you built for Project 1. Identify the VMs on the network and what they do.

    - Which VMs should be publicly accessible?

    - Which VMs should not be publicly accessible?


3. Explain the Solution Requirements

    - Consider the VMs that should not be publicly accessible from the internet. Which alert(s) should these VMs fire and when?

    - Why should these VMs be associated with these alerts?


4. Explain the Solution Details

    - Which tool in Project 1 would you use to set such an alert?

    - What would the alert rule be? For example, would the alert fire upon a failed SSH attempt or a ping request?


5. Identify Advantages and Disadvantages

    - Are there any malicious circumstances that the alert(s) discussed above do not address?

**Question 2: Challenges of Collecting Large Amounts of Log Data**

What are the challenges of collecting huge amounts of log data? How do security analysts deal with them?

1. Restate the Problem


2. Provide a Concrete Example Scenario

    - In Project 1, when did you deal with log data?
    - What kind(s) of data did you investigate?
    - How much data were you dealing with?
    - What were you looking for?


3. Explain the Solution Requirements

    - What information did you need to find what you were looking for?
    - What does an analyst need to analyze large amounts of log data to find this information?
    - In Project 1, what tools did you use to analyze log data?


4. Explain the Solution Details

    - How did you use these tools to find the log data? E.g., which charts, graphs, etc. were useful for parsing the logs?


5. Identify Advantages and Disadvantages of the Solution

    - What kinds of data did you not inspect during Project 1?
    - Would having access to this additional data have changed your process or conclusions? If so, how?
